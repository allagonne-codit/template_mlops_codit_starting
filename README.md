# MLOps Best Practices Demo Project

This project demonstrates MLOps best practices for machine learning projects, moving from Jupyter notebooks to a production-ready setup.

## Current vs. Proposed Approach

### Current Approach Limitations:
- Jupyter notebooks mixing code, data, and outputs
- Manual model training process
- No version control for data and models
- No automated testing
- Manual deployment process
- No monitoring or tracking of model performance

### MLOps Best Practices (This Project):
1. **Version Control (Git)**
   - Structured project organization
   - Collaborative development
   - Code review process

2. **Data Version Control (DVC)**
   - Track large files and datasets
   - Reproducible data pipelines
   - Data versioning

3. **Automated Training (Airflow)**
   - Scheduled model training
   - Pipeline orchestration
   - Error handling and notifications

4. **Experiment Tracking (MLflow)**
   - Track model parameters
   - Compare model versions
   - Store model artifacts

5. **Testing and Validation**
   - Unit tests for code quality
   - Model validation
   - Data validation

6. **Containerization (Docker)**
   - Reproducible environments
   - Easy deployment
   - Scalable infrastructure
